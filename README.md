# PinkBlue - An online flea market for artifacts

## Preface
This a document for unfamiliar developers to learn about the idea behind the project. It also provided an explanation how the mobile app is implemented with Flutter, the poopular Dart framework and how to test and debug through Android/iOS emulators in Visual Studio(preferred). Finally, the repo is open-source with MIT licence which means every interested developer is encouraged to learn, discuss and provide constructive advice toward the project.

## Motivation
There are numerous people around the world loving pieces of design/art, from a curved nectlace, a textile handbag to blanket in the living room. However, the ways by which they can access and know about these little artifacts are in pitiful numbers and disperse. It is hard to find a platform that solely do business on these products and provide fair price and community environment to thrive in. Here, PinkBlue<sup>@</sup> provides a user-friendly platform for art lovers to learn about these artifacts and chance to buy directly from the artists. Furthermore, the artists are able to earn extra income through these trades.
